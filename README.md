Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance plans. Secure communications are invaluable to this type of company, as the company deals with a lot of sensitive information collection and transactions.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I found it pretty simple to generate the vulnerability report and track down the issues causing many of the vulnerabilities. Software security eliminates a company's risk of information leak or stealing. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I could not for the life of me figure out the checksum evaluations. They were not clearly expressed how to do at all and I sadly never figured it out. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I utilized an encryption algorithm and a hashing algorithm to protect information. Specifically, I used the AES and the SHA-256 algorithms.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I periodically ran dependency checks to the code after making adjustments. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I found several tutorials on running and reading the vulnerability reports that helped me understand them a little more. I will definitely utilize any tutorials that  I can find that may be helpful. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would definitely show the vulnerability reports and certificates that I generated within this project. I believe the write-ups on the projects themselves to be helpful as well.
